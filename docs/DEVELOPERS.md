# Developer guide

ModCoreTemplates provides the `mc.*` Lua runtime and generates menu identities
with the `MCT_` prefix.

For the current template declaration, target, lifecycle, and menu contracts,
use [Lifecycle draft](LIFECYCLE-DRAFT.md), [Template menus](MENUS.md), and
[Object source](OBJECT-SOURCE.md).

ModCoreControls owns native quickslot input and its `mcc.*` API.
ModCoreTemplates owns visual template selection and lifecycle. The Fangdango
Wheels and Bar declarations in `Fangdango/Scripts/templates/` are current
examples of managed templates.
