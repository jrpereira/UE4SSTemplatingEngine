# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Rename the module to KEngineTemplates (KET), with UE4SS mod folder `_KEngineTemplates` and DMM provider ID `KEngineTemplates`. Use the `ket.*` API and `KET_` saved setting IDs.
- Require KEngineBridge API 5 for native Enhanced Input delivery.
- Preserve `tabNavigation=1` on navigation tabs and expose their generated IDs through `definition.navigation` without a config binding.

## 0.0.19 - 2026-09-23

- Load category objects directly at boot and generate category and template menus with shared quickslot controls.
- Merge category and template settings before delivering them to lifecycle hooks.
- Generate Advanced quickslot group bindings and require group selection before slot activation.
- Support template fields whose visibility follows another picker, and place a single template picker in the page header.
- Retry Enhanced Input attachment when the pawn input component is created or a map finishes loading.

## 0.0.18 - 2026-09-22

- Remove the obsolete `collection` field and use category/name identities for templates.
- Let a template's `single` value override category metadata, with category metadata as the fallback when omitted.
- Rebuild generated DMM category pages idempotently after loading a game.
- Add heading-free provider groups and align the Input Method tabs with the template picker.
- Give the first group activation binding `Tap | Hold | Default` (`0|2|-1`) while preserving sustain-style `Tap | Hold` (`0|2`) for later groups and `0|1` for regular slots.
- Require boolean `settings.enabled`; bundled templates default to `true`, and TE skips lifecycle methods while disabled.

- Validate category event interests and route declared events through service-first template callbacks.
- Retry pending attachments when a declared category event arrives.
- Validate committed provider settings before template attachment.
- Name template declarations `settings` and deliver committed values as `configuration.settings` while preserving persisted setting identities.
- Add `te.widget` helpers for safe UE property reads, transforms, opacity, and slot snapshots.
- Resolve category targets in TE and pass them to `attach`, removing target discovery from template services.
- Add `npc.attacks` and declarative native-class creation events owned and scheduled by TE.
- Add the inert `menu.fixes` template category.
- Split template selection into an aggregate `Templates` DMM page and generated category pages that own each template's detailed controls.
- Add the DMM startup extension that injects generated category pages while keeping their settings rooted in TE's shared `config.ini`.
- Add the `menu.controls` and `menu.templates` template categories.
- Add the `other` category family with the `other.unknown` fallback category.
- Store registered subcategories as `_categories[module][category]`, initialized with `visible`, `count`, and `templates`.
- Add `setCategory(category, values)` for category metadata such as `visible`.
- Track each successfully loaded template in its category's `count` and `templates` fields.

## 0.0.17

- Register individual template files or folders containing Lua templates.
- Validate one template object or nested dense arrays of templates.
- Generate persistent Adaptive Mod Menu controls for `player.quickslots` templates.
- Provide protected, service-first `attach`, `render`, and `detach` lifecycle calls.
- Preserve historical Quickslots setting identifiers across the category rename.
- Recognize the built-in `player.*` and `npc.*` category families.
- Include the menu-test host used while native discovery, input, and visual cutover remain under development.
